# Express.js Note Taker

[![License: MIT](https://img.shields.io/badge/License-MIT-yellow.svg)](https://opensource.org/licenses/MIT)

## Description

The aim of this project was to create a note taking app using Express.js. This application allows one to create, save, read, and delete notes. Working on this project provided me with further understanding on the Express routes and how to connect the back-end and the front-end in an app.

## Usage

On the main page a user will be prompted to enter the note taker app. Once in the app, the user will see the titles of their notes on the left side of the screen and a space to create a new note on the right. The user will be able to view a full note by clicking on its title, create a new note by clicking on "+", and save it to the notes list. Each note can also be deleted.
